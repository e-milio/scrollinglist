        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>End Credits for the Places That Make Us is a participatory art project, initiated by Emilio Martínez Poppe, that invites reflection and collective recording of the ways urban places and our memory of them are layered in our bodies, in language, and in the world around us. This website serves as a platform for aggregating these “credits”. All visitors to the Queens Museum from October 7, 2018 to February 24, 2019 are welcome to participate. The credits will be on display near the entrance to the Panorama of the City of New York until the end of the exhibition after which they will be hosted for public view on the Volumes: Queens International 2018 website.</p>
        <p>You are invited to honor a place (or places) that you feel have nurtured a sense of belonging in you and that are no longer there as such. This is to say, this place has been removed, replaced, forgotten, or your relationship to it has changed through distance and time.</p>
        <p>This is one of three kiosks in the museum where you can make an entry in the collective credits. The credits are installed in the North-East corner of the museum and can be viewed from the first floor and the second floor mezzanine. A site map with accessible routes through the museum can be found below.</p>
