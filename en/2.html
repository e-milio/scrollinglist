        <h2>About</h2>
        <p><em>End Credits for the Places That Make Us</em> is a participatory art project, initiated by Emilio Martínez Poppe, that invites reflection and collective recording of the ways urban places and our memory of them are layered in our bodies, in language, and in the world around us. This website serves as a platform for aggregating these “credits”. All visitors to the Queens Museum from October 7, 2018 to February 24, 2019 are welcome to participate. The credits will be on display near the entrance to the <em>Panorama of the City of New York</em> until the end of the exhibition after which they will be hosted for public view on the <em>Queens International 2018: Volumes</em> website.</p>
        <p>You are invited to evoke and honor a place (or places) that you feel have nurtured a sense of belonging in you and that are no longer there as such. This is to say, this place has been removed, replaced, forgotten, or your relationship to it has changed through distance and time.</p>
        <p>These are places that have held us in ways that shaped who we are and how we define community. Places that would remember us when we were not there. Places that are now absent but continue to live in us. How do we carry them onward?</p>
        <p>This is one of three kiosks in the museum where you can make an entry in the collective credits. Each kiosk hosts different prompts which facilitate different way of evoking the places that make us. The credits are installed in the North-East corner of the museum and can be viewed from the second floor mezzanine. A site map with accessible routes through the museum can be found below.</p>
